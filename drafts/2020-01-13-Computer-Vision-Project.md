It has been

Well, it has been a wild semester. Between my MIT Driverless's commitments, MIT (Not-Driverless) Motorsports power limiting role, and classes my free time has been a bit non-existent.

I'm not complaining, just apologising to you, my loyal (and I suspect non-existent) readers for lack of content. Every year I pledge to post more and every year I get so caught up in projects that I fail to do so.

Still, I would like to post a couple of things. Next semester is also when I will fulfill my technical writing requirements so maybe that will help keep me on track? What do they say about insanity and expecting a different result.

Alright, a quick summary of cool things which happened this semester.

At Driverless, I was elevated to controls lead after the inestimable Allen Wang died.. passed into the unholy corporate veil.. err... I mean graduated.

Taking on a technical leadership role has been really really fun. I have a personal sort of perfectionism that just loves being able to organize and build a single system and constantly work and tweak it.

Managing other engineers has also been really fun. I've got a bit of experience with this from the scouts and high school teams but still a relatively new experience. It is incredible fulfilling to be able to work with and manage such incredibly capable and talented engineers (many of whom are more proficient than me).

I also had an opportunity to take MIT's 6.869 Advances in Computer Vision. This was my first graduate level class and it was so much fun.

I really can't recommend the course enough. It basically is two professors presenting papers they think were significant in the past 20 years.

The work load is very light for a graduate class. There are no exams. It is entirely project-focuesed. The grade is 60% problem sets and 40% the final project.

As much as you might think that the class is entirely machine learning dominiated (and admittedly the entire second half is dominated by that) it also provides a really solid understanding of the earlier CV things. We cover camera models and epipolar geometry of course.

The class textbook is also epic - the Muliview Geometry by XXXXXX XXXXXX.

Any way, I was very proud of my final project. Completed with my good friend Max Tell, we worked on the problem of estimating camera calibrations from natural images. (A useful topic for a Driverless).
