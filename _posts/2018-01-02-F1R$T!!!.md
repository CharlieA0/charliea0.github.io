Welcome back the mishmash horror haunting this dark corner of the net. My portfolio site lives AGAIN!

In all seriousness though, this website replaces my high school collection of the coding projects. I will try to resurrect some of those previous projects in my spare time (or lack thereof) and going forward I'll add new posts and work here.

## A quick update

Right now I am working on MIT's Robotics Team. My subgroup is competing in the Microtransat Challenge. We are building a autonomous vehicle that will navigate across the Atlantic. I will probably post updates and illustrations of my work on that pretty frequently.

I am also part of SIPB, MIT's computing club, so any projects I complete with them should also end up here. Other than that, anything's game to end up on this site.

Till next time... BWAHHAHHHAHH!
