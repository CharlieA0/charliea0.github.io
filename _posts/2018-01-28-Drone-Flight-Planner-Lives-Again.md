I've resurrected the flight planner I wrote for my high school autonomous drone research project.

This project let us create paths of waypoints for quadcopter to follow faster and more accurately that looking up coordinates in Google Earth. It also let specify commands like HOVER or CIRCLE to perform at waypoints. This was my first real foray in to web development.

Please enjoy!
